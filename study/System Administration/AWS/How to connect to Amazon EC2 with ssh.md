To connect to your EC2 instance from your Debian computer using SSH, follow these steps:

### 1. **Open a Terminal**

On your Debian machine, open a terminal window.

### 2. **Move the Key File**

Ensure that the private key file you downloaded (likely a `.pem` file) is in a secure location. For example, move it to your home directory under a folder called `.ssh`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh mv /path/to/your-key.pem ~/.ssh/
```

### 3. **Set Proper Permissions**

Ensure that the `.pem` file has the correct permissions. This is important for security reasons, as SSH will refuse to use the key if it is accessible to others:

```bash
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/your-key.pem
```

### 4. **Find Your EC2 Public IP**

Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to your EC2 instance to find its **Public IPv4 address**.

### 5. **SSH Command**

Use the following command to connect to your EC2 instance. Replace the placeholders with your actual key file name and EC2 instance's public IP:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ec2-user@<instance-public-ip>
```

- `your-key.pem`: The name of your private key file.
- `<instance-public-ip>`: The public IP of your EC2 instance.

### 6. **Username**

- For Amazon Linux 2 or Amazon Linux AMI: `ec2-user`
- For Ubuntu: `ubuntu`
- For Debian: `admin` or `debian` (depending on the setup).

So if you are using Debian on your EC2 instance, your SSH command may look like this:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem debian@<instance-public-ip>
```
### Troubleshooting:

- Ensure that port `22` (SSH) is open in your EC2 security group.
- Ensure that your EC2 instance is running and reachable from your network.
