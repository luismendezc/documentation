As you’ve seen, structs let us combine individual pieces of data to make something new, then attach methods so we can manipulate that data.

Today you’re going to learn about some of the more advanced features of structs that make them more powerful, including static properties and access control – the art of stopping other parts of your code from meddling in places they ought not to be.

There’s a famous quote that is sadly anonymous, but I think it fits well here: “privacy is power – what people don’t know, they can’t ruin.” As you’ll see, the same is true in Swift: hiding access to certain properties and methods can actually make our code _better_, because there are fewer places able to access it.

As a reminder, both of these things are used extensively in SwiftUI, so it’s worth taking the time to master them now because they’ll be in use from our very first project onwards.

**Today you have two tutorials to work through, where you’ll meet multiple levels of access control, and also the ability to create static properties and methods.** Once you’ve watched each video and any optional extra reading you wanted, there’s a short test to help make sure you’ve understood what was taught.
