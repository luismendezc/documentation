Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson once said, “success isn't always about greatness, it's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success; greatness will come.”

Obviously I want to get you towards SwiftUI greatness as fast and effectively as possible, but that takes a lot of consistency from you. To be fair, it is already day 31 and you keep coming back, so you’re fulfilling your part of the deal – well done!

With another project done, it’s time for you to take matters into your own hands. Yes, this is the “hard work” part of the project, where you need to complete some challenges without my help, and also pass a test to make sure what you’re learning is sinking in.

You can do this!

**Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 5, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.**
