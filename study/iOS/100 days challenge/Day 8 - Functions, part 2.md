Today you’re going to learn about handling errors in functions. That might sound awfully pessimistic, but as John Lennon said “life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans” – no one _wants_ problems, but life has a habit of finding them anyway!

Fortunately, Swift makes error handling straightforward and somewhat foolproof: it _requires_ that we handle errors, or at least acknowledge that they might happen. If you don’t at least attempt to handle errors well, your code simply won’t compile.

**Today you have two tutorials to work through**, in which you’ll meet default values for parameters and throwing functions, and then we’ll summarize functions and look at checkpoint 4. Once you’ve completed each video, there is a short piece of optional extra reading if you’re looking to get some more details, and there’s also a short test to help make sure you’ve understood what was taught.
