## First steps in Swift

---

SwiftUI is a powerful framework for building user-interactive apps for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and even watchOS. But you can’t build software without having a programming language, so behind SwiftUI lies Swift itself: a powerful, flexible, and modern programming language that you’ll use for all your SwiftUI apps.

As Mark Twain once said, “the secret to getting ahead is getting started.” Well, you’re starting _now_, so we’re going to dive in and learn about variables, constants, and simple data types in Swift.

**Today you have seven tutorials to complete.** If you want to dive deeper into each topic there is optional further reading, but you don’t need to read that unless you want to and have the time. Regardless, there are a number of short tests to help make sure you’ve understood key concepts.

I know, I know: the temptation is strong to continue on to watch more videos and take more tests beyond those linked below, but remember: don’t rush ahead! It’s much better to do one hour a day every day than do chunks with large gaps between.

When you’re finished, don’t forget to tell other people about your progress. Yes, this is only day one, but the more motivation you get now the more you’ll be able to power through when things get tougher!

**Reminder:** I have a free iOS app that helps you practice Swift right on your iPhone and iPad. It contains alternative lessons that might help these new concepts sink in, plus lots more bonus activities. And did I mention it was free? [Download it here](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1440611372).

## Tips

- You can download Xcode from the Mac App Store by [clicking here](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
- As you progress in these early days you’ll build up lots of code from each day. You can keep it in different playgrounds if you want, or you can delete it – it’s down to you.

## How can this day be improved?

Great job on finishing another day! If you still have questions about what you learned, please send them in [using this form](https://forms.gle/46JyxuEKtsPpGCs47) – I'll do my best to address the most common problems in the next course update. Thank you!
