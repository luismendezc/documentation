Albert Einstein once said, “any fool can know; the point is to understand,” and this project was specifically about giving you a deeper understanding of what makes SwiftUI tick. After all, you’ll be spending the next 76 days working with it, so it’s a good idea to make sure your foundations are rock solid before moving on.

I could have said to you “SwiftUI uses structs for views” or “SwiftUI uses `some View` a lot”, and in fact _did_ say exactly that to begin with when it was all you needed to know. But now that you’re progressing beyond the basics, it’s important to feel comfortable with what you’re using – to eliminate the nagging sense that you don’t quite get what something is for when you look at your code.

So much of Swift was built specifically for SwiftUI, so don’t be worried if you’re looking at some of the features and thinking they are way beyond your level. If you think about it, they were well above _everyone’s_ level until Swift shipped with them!

**Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 3, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.**
