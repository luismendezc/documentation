Today we’re going to build our project, combining both SwiftUI and Core ML in remarkably few lines of code – I think you’ll be impressed.

What I hope you’ll get from this project – apart from all the SwiftUI goodies, of course – is just a little glimpse into the wider world of app development. Core ML is just one of Apple’s powerhouse frameworks, and there are over a dozen more: ARKit, Core Graphics, Core Image, MapKit, WebKit, and more, are all waiting to be discovered when you’re ready.

I realize that you might have thought “wow, we’re looking at machine learning already?” After all, this is only day 27 of a 100-day course. But, as Andre Gide said, “you cannot discover new oceans unless you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.”

**Today you have three topics to work through, and you’ll get busy implementing `Stepper`, `DatePicker`, `DateFormatter`, and more in a real app.**
