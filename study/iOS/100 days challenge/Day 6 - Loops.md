Loops are one of the things that make computers so utterly brilliant: the ability to repeat some simple task billions of times every second.

Of course, what _goes_ in those loops is down to you: you might be adding some numbers, you might be reading some sensor data, or you might be redrawing the screen 120 times a second. As Craig Bruce said, “it’s hardware that makes a machine fast, but it’s software that makes a fast machine slow.”

**Today you have three tutorials to work through, plus a summary and a checkpoint.** Once you’ve completed each video you can read the optional extra section, and there’s a short test to help make sure you’ve understood what was taught.
