If there’s one line from Shakespeare’s _Hamlet_ that most people know, it’s “to be or not to be, that is the question.” Shakespeare meant that as the ultimate question of life or death, but it just so happens that Hamlet strikes right at the heart of logic in programming: evaluating whether a condition is true or not.

Today we’re going to get into the real detail of Swift: operators and conditions, which let us evaluate our program’s state as it runs and take different action depending on the result. There are several ways of doing it and you’ll need them all, but we’ll walk through them step by step so you can see how they compare.

**Today you have four tutorials to work through, where you’ll meet things like `if`, `switch`, and more.** Once you’ve watched each video and optionally gone through the extra reading, there’s a short test to help make sure you’ve understood what was taught.
