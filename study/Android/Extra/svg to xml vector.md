Yes, you can export your Inkscape designs as Android Vector Drawables (XML files) similar to the one you've shared. Here's how you can do it:

### Using Inkscape and a Conversion Tool

Inkscape itself does not natively export to Android Vector Drawable format, but you can use an online converter or a script to convert the SVG file to an Android Vector Drawable XML file.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Create and Save Your SVG in Inkscape:**
   - Design your logo or resource in Inkscape.
   - Once you're done, save your file with a `.svg` extension.

2. **Use an Online Converter:**
   - There are several online tools that can convert SVG files to Android Vector Drawables. One popular tool is [SVG to Android VectorDrawable](https://inloop.github.io/svg2android/).

3. **Convert SVG to Android Vector Drawable:**
   - Go to the online converter tool.
   - Upload your SVG file.
   - The tool will convert the SVG to an XML file formatted for Android Vector Drawable.
   - Download the resulting XML file.

4. **Modify the XML File (if necessary):**
   - Sometimes the conversion may not be perfect, and you might need to tweak the XML file to better suit your needs.
   - You can open the XML file in any text editor and make adjustments as necessary.

### Alternate Method: Using Command Line Tools

For a more automated and possibly more customizable approach, you can use command-line tools such as `svg2vectorxml`, which is a Python-based tool.

#### Using `svg2vectorxml`:

1. **Install svg2vectorxml:**
   - You need Python installed on your system.
   - Install `svg2vectorxml` using pip:
     ```sh
     pip install svg2vectorxml
     ```

2. **Convert SVG to Vector Drawable:**
   - Use the following command to convert your SVG file:
     ```sh
     svg2vectorxml yourfile.svg
     ```
   - This will generate an XML file in the same directory as your SVG file.

### Example of Conversion Command:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your SVG file is located.
3. Run the conversion command:
   ```sh
   svg2vectorxml yourfile.svg
   ```
4. The tool will create an XML file with the same name as your SVG file in the same directory.

### Final Steps:

- Once you have the XML file, you can include it in your Android project's `res/drawable` directory.
- Reference it in your layout files or other resources as needed.

#### Example Usage in Android:

```xml
<ImageView
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:src="@drawable/your_converted_vector"/>
```

By following these steps, you should be able to convert your Inkscape designs into Android Vector Drawables and use them in your Android projects.
