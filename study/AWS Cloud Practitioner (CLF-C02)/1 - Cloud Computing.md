Trade CAPEX (Upfront Expense) for OPEX (Variable Expenses).
Stop Focusing on Data Centers, better focus on Customers.
Stop Guessing Capacity, extreme scalability.
Economies of Scale.
Increase Provision Speed and Business Agility, clou computing request in seconds or minutes.
Go Global, global deployment options.
